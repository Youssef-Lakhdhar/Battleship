# Battleship
Here is an implementation of Battleship game playable in terminal.

It is a game where the player has to locate and shoot enemies (ships).

To do that, the player should select the raw and the column of the position that it wants to target.
If he shoots a part of a boat, position is marked with "o". So the player can guess where is the rest of the ship.
Otherwise, the position turns into a "x" symbol.
Player's goal is to kill the five enemies using as few bullets as possible.

When the player shoots all the ships, his score is saved in the score.txt file that he can review once game is over.
